**Describe the error or crash**


**Can you cause the error to happen by doing anything?**


**Optional:**
**Screenshots of match**

**What was the game clock? ( -1:30 to 0:00 to xx:xx )**

**Are you in an All Pick match, with 5 players vs 5 players, on Local Dev Script custom lobby?**
**If not, state the game settings for your match**


**Console dump (best if you pause the match right when it happens)**
```
Copy and paste any console text here
```
<sub>_Note: If you run the game with the -dev launch option there will be console dumps at "%SteamInstall%/steamapps/common/dota 2 beta/game/dota/console.#########.log"_</sub>
